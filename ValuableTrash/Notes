Read both compressed and uncompressed fastq files and be able to write both compressed or uncompressed files according to user input (gzip only).

Be able to use both Phred+33 and Phred+64 encoding according to user input.

Autodetect the quality scale of a file (phred+33 or phred+64).

Trim X nucleotides from the 3' of each read given user input.

Trim each read from the 3' based on quality, either as minimum (single residue) or mean of moving window.

These trims from 3' can be done independently of each other in above order.

Trim X nucleotides from the 5' of each read given user input.

Trim each read from the 5' based on quality, either as minimum (single residue) or mean of moving window.

These trims from 5' can be done independently of each other in above order.

Filter out reads with a mean quality lower than specified after trimming.

Filter out reads that are shorter than specified after trimming.

Filter out reads that have a more than a specified number of N bases (unknown bases).

Must keep track of how many reads are trimmed, removed etc. Put the result in a (user specified) log file
