## Questions and CO

 Maybe read file twice
- first read: triming - storing in file (creating list with corresponding phred score)
- second read: filtering (while reading second file counting N bases)

- create a dict which contains N bases with strings 
    -- read is the key, number of nbases is the value
- create dict with quality

### open the document several times?
- open the document several times and perform functions ! performance
- open once perform all functions?

possibility to use a dict for improvement - but have to read

***to do while reading***
- save number of n bases in variable - create dict?

in mind? 

### Improving runtime

### Storing File 
gzip is preferable improvement in runtime
